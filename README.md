# python-CSVDataset
Build CSV Dataset from an Image

To implemen in your image data, then you must have 28x28 image with 8 depth 
8-bit color: 2^8 = 256 colors

To get Image depth 8 bit you must preprocess you Image data using Threshold Algorithm (I do)

The Image data will store in 784 which is the x*y of 28x28
